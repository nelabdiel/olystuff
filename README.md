This code scrapes the IWF (International Weightlifting Federation) website and pulls the top totals.

Then does comparisons between weight classes, and ultimately compares sinclair total.

This is work in progress.

Ultimately the idea would be to develop a better comparison than the sinclair total, for lifters in different weight classes.
